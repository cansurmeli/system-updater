# Update System

A simple utility to properly update your macOS system all at once.

## What's Updated

- Homebrew
- App Store apps
- PIP
- Ruby

## Why Properly Updated

Once you want to do a full update of your system, there are various commands to be executed.

Moreover, some of these commands fill up a cache that needs to be regularly cleaned so that unnecessary software doesn't take up valuable space on your system.

Hence, it's cumbersome to enter each and every one of these commands one after another. Considering the fact that you're going to wait between each execution means that the whole process will take up a lot of time.

This script goes through whatever is needed so that you don't have to deal with it.

## Requirements

- Homebrew
- mas: required for updating the App Store apps from the CLI
	- `brew install mas`

## Usage

`updateSystem [OPTIONS] [ENV]`

## Command Line Argument Options

- **-h, --help:** See a synopsis.
- **-o, --output:** Output the logs to a given file.
- **-v, --verbose:** While updating, be verbose & output what's being generated by each and every command. The default is that merely the main command entrances and exits will de displayed.

**Maybe later:**

- **-p, --progress:** Display a progress bar.

## Available Update Environments
