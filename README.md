# macOS System Updater

A simple-to-use CLI utility to properly update your macOS installation all at once.

## Why Properly Updated

Once you want to do a full update of your macOS installation, there occurs various struggles:

1. **GUI hassles:** Some updates can be accomplished by their respective GUIs, however, it's cumbersome; especially the Mac App Store which still doesn't reflect the changes properly,
2. **Complex Commands:** Even though some commands are easy to type, others can be more elaborate,
2. **Keeping track of caches:** These commands fill up their caches that needs to be cleaned regularly which is another thing for you to keep track of,
3. **Time lost:** If you're manually entering these commands, you're going to have to wait in between them; losing time.

With all these hassles, it could be that someone might not update their system too often; not because they can't but they don't want to deal with it. Or it could be that they're forgetting something; e.g. cache cleanups.

Hence, this script was created. So that people can properly update their macOS installation.

It goes through major things that can be on a macOS installation and updates them properly/throughly.
